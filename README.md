# JubJub

**JubJub** named after collateral character of the famous [poem](jabberwocky.md) by L. Carroll. It is a daemon for server side logging of XMPP packages.

**JubJub** based upon module architecture so it is possible to flexible reassign handlers for different types of XMPP packages.

Originally **JubJub** was designed for [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/) server. But probably it can work with other Jabber servers.
